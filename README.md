🌱 Soil Texture Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and experiments for my Polygence research project, conducted under the mentorship of Leonard Gleyzer (PhD Candidate, Applied Mathematics, Brown University). The project explores how deep learning models can be applied to classify soil textures from experimental data, with potential applications in precision agriculture, soil monitoring, and sustainable land management.

📌 Project Overview

Soil plays a central role in agriculture, water retention, and carbon storage. Traditional soil texture classification methods are manual and time-intensive. In this project, we develop a neural network model that classifies soil texture automatically, reducing human error and improving scalability.


📊 Results

Preliminary accuracy: 1.00

Coded for confusion matrix and loss plots are included in the output.py file
These are the the example:

🌍 Applications

Smart irrigation: better soil-water management.

Crop planning: selecting crops suited to soil type.

Sustainable agriculture: monitoring soil health at scale.
