🌱 Soil Texture Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and experiments for my Polygence research project, conducted under the mentorship of Leonard Gleyzer (PhD Candidate, Applied Mathematics, Brown University). The project explores how deep learning models can be applied to classify soil textures from experimental data, with potential applications in precision agriculture, soil monitoring, and sustainable land management.

📌 Project Overview

Soil plays a central role in agriculture, water retention, and carbon storage. Traditional soil texture classification methods are manual and time-intensive. In this project, we develop a neural network model that classifies soil texture automatically, reducing human error and improving scalability.

⚙️ Features

Data preprocessing: cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.

Neural network classifier implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.

Training and evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.

Colab-compatible notebook for easy reproduction.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/classifying_soil_texture.git
cd classifying_soil_texture

2. Install dependencies

You can install the required packages in your environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Or, open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

3. Run the notebook

Upload the dataset and run all cells in:

polygence_fixed.ipynb

📊 Results

Preliminary accuracy: to be filled in with your experiment results.

Confusion matrix and training/validation plots are included in the notebook.
